Yes it's about time, I'm starting a blog. This is not a "new-years-resolution" thing, but rather I have some time off, 
that happens to around new years.

This will mostly be tech focussed. Libraries, tools and things I find cool as a platform engineer.
I don't think I have the discipline to write long in depth articles or tutorials. 
The format will be mostly short but too long for Twitter.

Finally, I'm doing it independent. I have full control of the whole site.
